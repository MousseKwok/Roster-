# Roster-
The program can add/remove students while maintaining the alphabetical order of the roster list, and is able to display the list to the professor.
If the roster list reaches some maximum size, subsequent students will be added to a second list “waitlist”. The waitlist is not alphabetized.
automatically move students from the waitlist to the roster list when the latter drops below the maximum size.
